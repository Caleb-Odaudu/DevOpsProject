## What is Cloud Computing?

Imagine your device runs out of space or you lose it — the cloud offers a way to store and access your data from anywhere securely.

- The cloud is a network of powerful computers connected via the internet.
- It acts like a digital backpack: files, photos, and apps are available anytime, anywhere.
- You don’t rely on physical hardware anymore — you simply connect, store, and use resources online.

## What is AWS Cloud?

There are several cloud providers like Azure, Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud, but **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a global leader in this space.

- Offers services like storage, computing, databases, networking, and more.
- Businesses and individuals use AWS to run applications without investing in expensive hardware.
- AWS is essentially a rental store for digital tools — only pay for what you use.

> A cloud provider gives access to remote storage and computing resources over the internet.

## Importance of AWS Cloud

AWS democratizes access to powerful tools, once exclusive to large enterprises — now available to startups, small businesses, and individual creators.

- Enables scalable, flexible infrastructure on-demand.
- Perfect for uncertain or fast-growing projects (like your MarketPeak platform).
- Operates on a **Pay-As-You-Go** model:
  - Only pay for the resources you actually use.
  - If demand increases, you scale up. If it drops, scale down and reduce costs.

>  Example: Instead of buying expensive servers upfront for a new app, use AWS to rent what you need, adjust as traffic grows, and avoid wasting resources.
